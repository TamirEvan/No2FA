# No2FA
No two-factor Auth requirements

GitHub, let me decide how I want my account secured. 

2FA is NOT "more secure" than a good password.

It's just another layer of crap to get logged in.

My projects are moving to GitLab: https://gitlab.com/tamirevan

and Bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/tamirevan/

***Note**: This is a fork of @howtophil's [No2FA](https://github.com/howtophil/No2FA).
You too can fork it, edit it to direct people to your new place(s), and show
that you are against forced 2FA nonsense.*
